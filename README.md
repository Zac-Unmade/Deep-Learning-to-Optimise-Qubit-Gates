# Deep-Learning-to-Optimise-Qubit-Gates
This repository contains the code for a novel approach to optimising pulse waveform parameters for high fidelity qubit gates, as presented in our paper. The method leverages Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to model the relationship between pulse amplitudes and gate fidelities, improving the implementation of quantum gates such as Hadamard, Pauli-X, and CNOT.

The approach is built around training DNNs on a dataset of amplitudes and corresponding fidelities, generated through quantum simulations in Qiskit. A two-stage process is used to fine-tune the amplitudes, achieving high fidelities for single-qubit gates (0.999976 for Hadamard, 0.999923 for Pauli-X) and reasonable fidelity for the two-qubit CNOT gate (0.695313). This repository provides the code for generating the dataset, training the DNNs, and using them for pulse scheduling optimisation.

Key features include:
- Simulation of quantum gate fidelities using Qiskit.
- Deep Neural Network-based optimisation for high-fidelity qubit gate implementations.
- Two-stage optimisation to maximize gate fidelities.
- A focus on single-qubit gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X) and two-qubit gates (CNOT).

This work is part of the ongoing effort to improve the scalability and precision of quantum computing systems.

## Usage
The project is organized into several components that correspond to different quantum gates and the deep learning optimisation process:

1. **Simulation Files** (`*.py` under Hadamard, Pauli-X, and CNOT directories):
   - Each simulation file (e.g., `Hadamard-Simulation.py`, `Pauli-X-Simulation.py`, `CNOT-Simulation.py`) generates the necessary data for their respective quantum gates. These files simulate the fidelities of the quantum gates (Hadamard, Pauli-X, and CNOT) by running quantum circuits and collecting the amplitude and fidelity data. You should run these simulation files first to generate the dataset for training the deep learning models.
2. **Optimisation Files** (`*.py` under Hadamard-Optimisation, Pauli-X-Optimisation, CNOT-Optimisation directories):
   - After you have collected the data from the simulation files, you can run the corresponding optimisation file (e.g., `Hadamard-Optimisation.py`, `Pauli-X-Optimisation.py`, `CNOT-Optimisation.py`). These scripts use deep learning techniques to optimise the pulse waveform parameters to improve the fidelity of the respective quantum gates. The optimisation process is built on the data generated by the simulations.
3. **Circuit Optimisation** (`Circuit-Optimisation.py`):
   - The `Circuit-Optimisation.py` file is intended as a foundation for future work where you can extend this method to optimise complete quantum circuits involving multiple gates (e.g., sequences of Hadamard, Pauli-X, and CNOT gates). It is a work-in-progress and provides the groundwork for optimising entire quantum circuits, rather than just individual gates.
4. **Utilities** (`utils.py`): 
   - The utils.py file contains common helper functions that are used across different scripts.
